- 👋 Hi, I’m @langdayu.
- 👀 I’m interested in computational algorithm of optimal transport with its application in deep learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning dymanic optimal transport, which is also known as fluid mechanics methods for computing OT. This problem is originally introducted by Benamou and Brenier.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on computational OT and its application in deep learning such as SSL(semi-supervised learning) e.t.c. .
